/*
 * itoa
 * 
 * Simple conversion routine
 * Converts binary to decimal numbers
 * Returns pointer to (static) char array
 * 
 * The integer argument is converted to a string
 * of digits representing the integer in decimal format.
 * The integer is considered signed, and a minus-sign
 * precedes the string of digits if the number is
 * negative.
 * 
 * This routine will return a varying number of digits, from
 * one digit (for integers in the range 0 through 9) and up to
 * 10 digits and a leading minus-sign (for the largest negative
 * 32-bit integers).
 * 
 * If the integer has the special value
 * 100000...0 (that's 31 zeros), the number cannot be
 * negated. We check for this, and treat this as a special case.
 * If the integer has any other value, the sign is saved separately.
 * 
 * If the integer is negative, it is then converted to
 * its positive counterpart. We then use the positive
 * absolute value for conversion.
 * 
 * Conversion produces the least-significant digits first,
 * which is the reverse of the order in which we wish to
 * print the digits. We therefore store all digits in a buffer,
 * in ASCII form.
 * 
 * To avoid a separate step for reversing the contents of the buffer,
 * the buffer is initialized with an end-of-string marker at the
 * very end of the buffer. The digits produced by conversion are then
 * stored right-to-left in the buffer: starting with the position
 * immediately before the end-of-string marker and proceeding towards
 * the beginning of the buffer.
 * 
 * For this to work, the buffer size must of course be big enough
 * to hold the decimal representation of the largest possible integer,
 * and the minus sign, and the trailing end-of-string marker.
 * The value 24 for ITOA_BUFSIZ was selected to allow conversion of
 * 64-bit quantities; however, the size of an int on your current compiler
 * may not allow this straight away.
